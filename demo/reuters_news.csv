USL2N24610R,EMERGING MARKETS-Latam FX fall as dollar rallies on dimmer hopes of aggressive U.S. rate cut,2019-07-06 00:00:00,"  (Updates prices)     By Susan Mathew     July 5 (Reuters) - Most Latin American currencies slipped on Friday as the dollar was lifted by hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not cut rates aggressively at its meeting this month.     The dollar rally was spurred by investors trimming bets of a 50-basis-point cut in U.S interest rates in July after data showed that U.S. jobs growth in June beat expectations strongly to the upside.     Regional currencies lost between 0.03% to 0.7%, with Brazil's real slipping from three-month highs hit last session, as the dollar climbed 0.5%.

The U.S. dollar        gained against a basket of currencies after an unexpectedly strong U.S. payrolls report that caused investors to rethink how dovish a turn the Federal Reserve may take.

The currency, which on Thursday notched an eight-month high at 1.3038, traded in a range of 1.3045 to 1.3136.     For the week, the loonie was nearly unchanged.     The Canadian dollar will edge higher against the greenback over the coming year, as a recovering domestic economy forestalls Bank of Canada interest rate cuts despite expected easing from the U.S. Federal Reserve, a Reuters poll predicted.

USLNS5IEF6Q,"U.S. job growth surges, July rate cut expectations intact",2019-07-05 00:00:00," By Lucia Mutikani   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth rebounded strongly in June, with government payrolls surging, but persistent moderate wage gains and mounting evidence the economy was losing momentum could still encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this month.   The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday suggested May's sharp slowdown in hiring was probably a fluke. Lack of concrete progress in resolving an acrimonious trade war between the United States and China, however, means the bar could be very high for the Fed not to lower borrowing costs at its July 30-31 policy meeting.    But the strong pace of job gains reduced the chances of a half percentage point rate cut at the end of the month. The U.S. central bank in June signaled it could ease monetary policy as early as this month citing low inflation and growing risks to the economy from an escalation in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.    ""We think the Fed is still on track for a 25 basis points cut given trade uncertainty and the steady downtrend in business sentiment,"" said Andrew Schneider, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas Securities in New York. ""An insurance cut by definition means getting ahead of a downturn, and waiting for employment to roll likely means being too late to deliver one.""    Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 jobs last month as government employment rose by the most in 10 months, and construction and manufacturing hiring regained speed. The economy created only 72,000 jobs in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 160,000 in June.   Job growth averaged 172,000 per month in the first half.  Hiring has cooled from an average of 223,000 jobs per month in 2018, in part as the economy runs out of workers. The pace, however, remains well above the roughly 100,000 needed to keep up with growth in the working age population.   The economy, which has expanded a record 10 years, has shifted into lower gear as the stimulus from last year's massive tax cuts and increased government spending fizzles.    The trade tensions are also dimming the economy's outlook by undercutting business confidence and leading to a downturn in equipment spending and manufacturing. Consumer spending is rising moderately and the housing market continues to struggle, while the trade deficit has widened again   President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week agreed to a trade truce and a return to talks. Trump has said he is in ""no hurry"" to make a deal and on Wednesday accused China and Europe of ""playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA.""   Trump on Friday said the robust employment gains indicated the United States continued to do ""really, really well"" and ""would be like a rocket ship,"" if the Fed lowered rates.   U.S. House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, welcomed the rebound in job growth, but said ""hard-working Americans are still struggling under the Trump administration's disastrous special interest agenda.""   The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.3% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter.   Average hourly earnings rose six cents or 0.2% in June after gaining 0.3% in May. That kept the annual increase in wages at 3.1% in June for a second straight month. The trend in wage growth has slowed from late last year when wages were rising at their fastest rate in a decade, pointing to moderate inflation.   Interest rate futures fully priced in a month-end rate cut, but dialed back expectations for an easing of 50 basis points. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street slipped.       EYES ON POWELL TESTIMONY    Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony to the U.S. Congress on the economy next week could shed light on the near-term outlook for monetary policy. The Fed in its semi-annual report to Congress on Friday repeated its pledge to ""act as appropriate"" to sustain economic growth.   ""There is no inflationary pressure coming from the labor side,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""It is hard to explain why wage gains are so slow in the current labor market.""    The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.7% last month as 335,000 people entered the labor market, a sign of confidence in their prospects of getting a job. Some of the recent drop in the jobless rate had been because of people leaving the labor market.    The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to 62.9% last month from 62.8% in May.   A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose to 7.2% in June from 7.1% in May.   Hiring picked up across nearly all sectors in June, though retail payrolls contracted for a fifth straight month, shedding another 5,800 jobs on top of the 7,300 lost in May.   Manufacturing payrolls accelerated by 17,000 jobs after rising by 3,000 in May. The surge in hiring is despite the sector struggling with an inventory bulge - concentrated in the automotive industry - trade tensions, design troubles at planemaker Boeing ( BA.N ) and slowing global growth.    Construction employment rose by 21,000 jobs last month after gaining 5,000 in May. Government payrolls rebounded by 33,000, the most since August 2018, after shedding 11,000 jobs in May. The surge in hiring was driven by local governments.   But leisure and hospitality sector payrolls increased by a moderate 8,000 in June after rising 18,000 in the prior month.  Professional and business services employment gained 51,000 jobs. There were increases in healthcare and transportation and warehousing employment.   The average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours in June for a third straight month.

The Fed in its semi-annual report to Congress on Friday repeated its pledge to ""act as appropriate"" to sustain economic growth.   ""There is no inflationary pressure coming from the labor side,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""It is hard to explain why wage gains are so slow in the current labor market.""    The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.7% last month as 335,000 people entered the labor market, a sign of confidence in their prospects of getting a job. Some of the recent drop in the jobless rate had been because of people leaving the labor market.    The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to 62.9% last month from 62.8% in May.   A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose to 7.2% in June from 7.1% in May.   Hiring picked up across nearly all sectors in June, though retail payrolls contracted for a fifth straight month, shedding another 5,800 jobs on top of the 7,300 lost in May.   Manufacturing payrolls accelerated by 17,000 jobs after rising by 3,000 in May. The surge in hiring is despite the sector struggling with an inventory bulge - concentrated in the automotive industry - trade tensions, design troubles at planemaker Boeing ( BA.N ) and slowing global growth.    Construction employment rose by 21,000 jobs last month after gaining 5,000 in May. Government payrolls rebounded by 33,000, the most since August 2018, after shedding 11,000 jobs in May. The surge in hiring was driven by local governments.   But leisure and hospitality sector payrolls increased by a moderate 8,000 in June after rising 18,000 in the prior month.  Professional and business services employment gained 51,000 jobs. There were increases in healthcare and transportation and warehousing employment.   The average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours in June for a third straight month.     ",Boeing Company:-1
USL2N2460MD,TREASURIES-Yields climb on robust U.S. jobs report,2019-07-06 00:00:00,"     * U.S. economy creates 224,000 jobs in June     * Traders price out 1/2-point cut at July Fed meeting     * Markets factor in 25 basis-point cut this month      * U.S. 10-year yields hit 1-week high, 2-year at 2-week peak   (Adds comment; updates prices)     By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss     NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board on Friday, after data showed the world's largest economy created far more jobs than expected in June, suggesting that the Federal Reserve will not aggressively cut interest rates later this month.     Analysts said the strong jobs report should not stop the Fed from reducing interest rates at its July policy meeting, but it did take a 50-basis-point cut off the table.     U.S. benchmark 10-year yields rose to a more than one-week high, while 2-year yields climbed to a two-week peak after the jobs report.     U.S. 10-year yields posted their largest daily rise since early January, while yields on the 2-year had their highest daily gain in more than four years. For 30-year yields, Friday's rise was the largest since early October 2018.     Data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 jobs last month as government employment rose by the most in 10 months. The economy created only 72,000 jobs in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 160,000 in June.     But wage gain growth slowed in June, rising just 0.2%, after gaining 0.3% in May.     ""The short end has abruptly abandoned any thought of a 50-basis-point rate cut this month and now greatly discounts anything other than an insurance cut of 25 basis points for the entire second half of the year,"" said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.     In afternoon trading, 10-year note yields rose to 2.068% , a one-week peak, from 1.955% late on Wednesday. They were last at 2.044%. Ten-year yields hit 1.939% on Wednesday, which was their lowest level since November 2016.     Yields on the 30-year bonds advanced to 2.546%, from 2.471% on Wednesday. At the short end of the curve, 2-year yields were up at 1.869%, from Wednesday's 1.766%. Earlier in the session, 2-year yields touched two-week highs of 1.888%.     After the data, U.S. rate futures have priced in just a 9.0% chance the U.S. central bank will lower interest rates by half a percentage point this month, down from 29% on Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.     Next week's spotlight will be on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who will deliver his semi-annual monetary report before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.      NatWest Markets, in a research note said, investors will be looking out for the Fed's reaction to the U.S.-China trade truce and the June employment numbers to gauge the possibility and  magnitude of an interest rate cut at the Fed's July meeting.

USL2N246011,"Foreign bond buyers lift Mexico peso despite trade threats, downgrades",2019-07-06 00:00:00," By Abraham Gonzalez   MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's peso, which swung wildly in early June after a Fitch downgrade and brief U.S. threat to impose tariffs, has steadied as the country's high interest rates attracted foreign buyers of bonds using borrowed money, analysts and economists said.   Under the ""carry trade"" strategy, investors borrow money in the currency of a country with low interest rates, such as the United States and some European countries, to buy bonds of a high-yield country like Mexico.   Mexico's Central Bank has kept its benchmark interest rate steady at 8.25% since hiking it in December to the highest level among all emerging countries except Turkey and Argentina.     The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate is 2.25%-2.50%.   ""To the extent that the spread of rates was increasing, the carry trade began to become more important,"" said Gabriela Siller, an economist at Mexican bank Banco Base.   Since December 2015 the spread has doubled as the central bank raised rates to contain inflationary pressures, and foreign holdings of Mexican debt have grown by 87.2 billion pesos  ($4.58 billion).   Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador regularly boasts of a strong economy, citing the peso  MXN=  as proof, despite a first-quarter contraction and signs of faltering investor confidence.   U.S. President Donald Trump vowed on May 30 to impose a tariff on all Mexican imports to stem a surge of illegal immigrants across the southern border, but suspended the threat after a bilateral deal was reached.        Fitch Ratings Inc downgraded Mexico's sovereign debt on June 5, citing trade tensions and risks from heavily indebted oil company Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], or Pemex, while Moody's lowered its outlook to negative.      Graphic: Mexican peso, click  tmsnrt.rs/2FRxIDt       The peso has strengthened 3.1% this year, to 19.0244 to the dollar on Friday, after slumping in the final 2018 quarter on Lopez Obrador's decision to cancel a partly built $13 billion airport for Mexico City.   ""It's not more optimism; it's the high yield that has attracted more capital and has sustained the exchange rate,"" said Siller.   Some analysts predict that as long as the U.S.-Mexico spread remains high, the carry trade will sustain the peso.   Joel Martinez, an economist at brokerage firm SIF ICAP, said Mexico is attractive also to investors in countries with low current account deficits and reasonable debt-to-GDP ratios.   Dollar inflows to Mexico from U.S. trade have also supported the exchange rate, with a growing surplus, he added.   Mexico logged a trade surplus of $101.7 million between January and May this year in seasonally adjusted terms, according to official data, compared with a deficit of $4.30 billion in the same period 2018.   ""The balance of payments is healthy,"" said Martinez.

The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate is 2.25%-2.50%.   ""To the extent that the spread of rates was increasing, the carry trade began to become more important,"" said Gabriela Siller, an economist at Mexican bank Banco Base.   Since December 2015 the spread has doubled as the central bank raised rates to contain inflationary pressures, and foreign holdings of Mexican debt have grown by 87.2 billion pesos  ($4.58 billion).   Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador regularly boasts of a strong economy, citing the peso  MXN=  as proof, despite a first-quarter contraction and signs of faltering investor confidence.   U.S. President Donald Trump vowed on May 30 to impose a tariff on all Mexican imports to stem a surge of illegal immigrants across the southern border, but suspended the threat after a bilateral deal was reached.        Fitch Ratings Inc downgraded Mexico's sovereign debt on June 5, citing trade tensions and risks from heavily indebted oil company Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], or Pemex, while Moody's lowered its outlook to negative.      Graphic: Mexican peso, click  tmsnrt.rs/2FRxIDt       The peso has strengthened 3.1% this year, to 19.0244 to the dollar on Friday, after slumping in the final 2018 quarter on Lopez Obrador's decision to cancel a partly built $13 billion airport for Mexico City.   ""It's not more optimism; it's the high yield that has attracted more capital and has sustained the exchange rate,"" said Siller.   Some analysts predict that as long as the U.S.-Mexico spread remains high, the carry trade will sustain the peso.   Joel Martinez, an economist at brokerage firm SIF ICAP, said Mexico is attractive also to investors in countries with low current account deficits and reasonable debt-to-GDP ratios.   Dollar inflows to Mexico from U.S. trade have also supported the exchange rate, with a growing surplus, he added.   Mexico logged a trade surplus of $101.7 million between January and May this year in seasonally adjusted terms, according to official data, compared with a deficit of $4.30 billion in the same period 2018.   ""The balance of payments is healthy,"" said Martinez.      ($1 = 19.0408 Mexican pesos)     ","CA, Inc.:-1"

The jobs report also pointed to persistent moderate wage gains and mounting evidence that the economy was losing momentum, which could still encourage the Fed to cut rates this month.

USL4N2461G6,UK competition regulator puts brake on Amazon's Deliveroo deal,2019-07-05 00:00:00," By Kate Holton and James Davey   (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator has stepped in to pause Amazon's ( AMZN.O ) deal with online food delivery group Deliveroo while it considers launching a full investigation.   Amazon led a $575 million fundraising in Deliveroo in May, making what the two parties called ""a minority investment"" and going up against Uber Eats ( UBER.N ) in the global race to dominate the market for takeaway meal deliveries.   On Friday Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it served an initial enforcement order (IEO) on the two companies on June 24, signaling possible concerns about the transaction.   The regulator, which referred to Amazon's investment as ""a minority shareholding"" said it had reasonable grounds for suspecting that Amazon and Deliveroo ""have ceased to be distinct"" or were putting in place or considering arrangements which would result in them ""ceasing to be distinct"".   The order requires Amazon and Deliveroo to operate independently for now, meaning they cannot press ahead with the tie-up. It gives the regulator time to decide if it will launch a formal ""Phase 1"" competition probe.   The Deliveroo investment is Amazon's latest attempt to enter the takeaway delivery market, worth around $100 billion globally, after it shut down its own service, Amazon Restaurants, first in the UK and then last month in the United States.    Deliveroo said it and Amazon had been working closely with regulators to obtain their approval. The two companies will argue that the investment will help Deliveroo grow its coverage, increase competition and boost the restaurant sector.   ""We believe this minority investment will enable Deliveroo to expand its services, benefiting consumers through increased choice and creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service,"" Amazon said in a statement.   Deliveroo noted that it was competing with a number of major companies in the sector and that the investment would help to create jobs and restaurants to expand.      RESTRICTIONS    IEOs do not prevent parties from continuing to talk to each other, but typically do prevent the transfer of key staff or the transfer of commercially sensitive information.   If the CMA were to undertake an investigation and find competition concerns then the companies could offer undertakings to try to address those concerns. That process could be compromised if the companies had already merged financially.   Neither Deliveroo or Amazon have disclosed a figure for Amazon's funding contribution.   Deliveroo competes in Britain with Just Eat ( JE.L ) and with Uber Eats which is also present in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. It also competes in Europe with Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero.     Headquartered in London, Deliveroo uses 60,000 riders dressed in black and teal jackets to deliver meals from more than 80,000 restaurants and takeaway outlets in 14 countries including France, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuwait.   Since former lawmaker Andrew Tyrie became chairman of the CMA a year a go, it has increasingly bared its teeth. In April it blocked supermarket group Sainsbury's ( SBRY.L ) 7.3 billion pound ($9.2 billion) takeover of rival Asda.    In April the regulator proposed some of the biggest reforms to auditing globally since the aftermath of the Enron scandal, while earlier this month it launched an investigation into the power wielded by Facebook ( FB.O ) and Google ( GOOGL.O ) in digital advertising markets.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index  finished down 0.7% on broad-based losses, capping the week's gains at 1.4%. The index retreated from more than 12-months highs hit a day earlier, fueled by hopes of easier monetary policy from major central banks.   The strong rebound in U.S. job growth in June tempered expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates by 50 basis points this month, which sent the dollar higher and U.S. stocks lower.    However, bets of a 25 basis point cut were still in play as data showed wage gains in the U.S. were tepid.   ""These (jobs growth) are good numbers, but a rate cut in July is still all but inevitable,"" said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.   Hopes of accommodative monetary policy by major central banks and a U.S.-China trade truce were drivers of a fourth week of gains for the European stocks benchmark.   With talks between Washington and Beijing set to resume next week, Citi economist Catherine Mann warned that the truce had not removed the uncertainty that is still weighing on the global growth outlook.   Swedish industrial technology group Hexagon ( HEXAb.ST ) is among those suffering. It announced 700 job cuts and warned of a drop in quarterly organic sales.

Labor Department data showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 224,000 jobs in June, the most in five months, and solidly beating economists' expectation of 160,000 additions.   Traders lowered their expectations of a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed at its policy meeting on July 30-31, although hopes remained high that the central bank would start easing monetary policy.   ""The jobs report showed the economy slowing but not faltering. That's important because one of the questions going into the jobs report was what it meant for the possibility of the Fed cutting rates at the end of the month,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.   ""They still may do a quarter-point cut as an insurance move, but this certainly says the data aren't weakening quickly.""   Wall Street's main indexes hit a closing record high on Wednesday on hopes of major central banks embracing looser monetary policy in the wake of slowing global growth and trade tensions.   Despite solid hiring numbers, the report also pointed to persistent moderate wage gains and mounting evidence that the economy was losing momentum, which could still encourage the Fed to cut interest rates this month.   Shares of banks, which have been under pressure from falling benchmark debt yields, rose 0.7% and helped drive a slight 0.1% gain in the financial sector, which was the only major S&P sector in the positive territory.   The defensive sectors - real estate, utilities and consumer staples - shed more than 1% each as a rise in U.S. Treasury yields made the dividend-paying companies less appealing.

Labor Department data showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 224,000 jobs in June, the most in five months, and solidly beating economists' expectation of 160,000 additions.   Traders lowered their expectations of a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed at its policy meeting on July 30-31, although hopes remained high that the central bank would start easing monetary policy.   ""The jobs report showed the economy slowing but not faltering. That's important because one of the questions going into the jobs report was what it meant for the possibility of the Fed cutting rates at the end of the month,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.   ""They still may do a quarter-point cut as an insurance move, but this certainly says the data aren't weakening quickly.""   Wall Street's main indexes hit a closing record high on Wednesday on hopes of major central banks embracing looser monetary policy in the wake of slowing global growth and trade tensions.   Despite solid hiring numbers, the report also pointed to persistent moderate wage gains and mounting evidence that the economy was losing momentum, which could still encourage the Fed to cut interest rates this month.   Shares of banks, which have been under pressure from falling benchmark debt yields, rose 0.7% and helped drive a slight 0.1% gain in the financial sector, which was the only major S&P sector in the positive territory.   The defensive sectors - real estate, utilities and consumer staples - shed more than 1% each as a rise in U.S. Treasury yields made the dividend-paying companies less appealing.   At 11:01 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 186.45 points, or 0.69%, at 26,779.55, the S&P 500 was down 23.66 points, or 0.79%, at 2,972.16 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 66.81 points, or 0.82%, at 8,103.42.   Trading volumes are likely to be thin at the end of a holiday-shortened week as markets were shut on Thursday for Independence Day holiday.   The Philadelphia chip index fell 1.3% after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd forecast a steep plunge in its second-quarter operating profit, as a supply glut and rising tariffs hit global demand for electronics.

USL2N24610R,EMERGING MARKETS-Latam FX fall as dollar rallies on dimmer hopes of aggressive U.S. rate cut,2019-07-06 00:00:00,"  (Updates prices)     By Susan Mathew     July 5 (Reuters) - Most Latin American currencies slipped on Friday as the dollar was lifted by hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not cut rates aggressively at its meeting this month.     The dollar rally was spurred by investors trimming bets of a 50-basis-point cut in U.S interest rates in July after data showed that U.S. jobs growth in June beat expectations strongly to the upside.     Regional currencies lost between 0.03% to 0.7%, with Brazil's real slipping from three-month highs hit last session, as the dollar climbed 0.5%.     But, tepid wage growth in the United States over the same period kept alive bets of a quarter-basis-point cut.     ""It (jobs data) reduces the scope for a 50bp cut this month, though does little to alter the easing narrative linked to the Fed,"" strategists at TD Securities wrote in a note.      Riskier assets such as those in emerging markets have been rising since last month on hopes of accommodative monetary policy by major central banks, and signs of progress in U.S.-China trade relations.     Brazil's real fell 0.4% after a strong rally on Thursday spurred by the government's pension reform bill clearing a key congressional hurdle, which paved the way for it to be put to a lower house plenary vote before the parliament breaks for recess.     On the week, the currency was on course for a 0.8% gain, reversing last week's decline.      Mexico's peso was flat, and was set to clock weekly gains of around 1.2%. A 0.7% drop in Chile's peso led losses in the region on Friday, followed by the Colombian currency's 0.6% dip.     Stocks in the region were mixed. Brazil shares rose 0.3% to hit fresh highs. Airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes  topped the Bovespa index after reporting a 6.5% rise in demand for flights in June.      Mexican shares dipped 0.1%, in line with U.S. stocks that declined after the jobs data.      In Argentina, both stocks and the currency climbed. According to a preliminary draft of the government's upcoming budget proposal, inflation should end 2019 under 40.3% while the economy shrinks 0.8%.

The dollar rally was spurred by investors trimming bets of a 50-basis-point cut in U.S interest rates in July after data showed that U.S. jobs growth in June beat expectations strongly to the upside.     Regional currencies lost between 0.03% to 0.7%, with Brazil's real slipping from three-month highs hit last session, as the dollar climbed 0.5%.     But, tepid wage growth in the United States over the same period kept alive bets of a quarter-basis-point cut.     ""It (jobs data) reduces the scope for a 50bp cut this month, though does little to alter the easing narrative linked to the Fed,"" strategists at TD Securities wrote in a note.      Riskier assets such as those in emerging markets have been rising since last month on hopes of accommodative monetary policy by major central banks, and signs of progress in U.S.-China trade relations.     Brazil's real fell 0.4% after a strong rally on Thursday spurred by the government's pension reform bill clearing a key congressional hurdle, which paved the way for it to be put to a lower house plenary vote before the parliament breaks for recess.     On the week, the currency was on course for a 0.8% gain, reversing last week's decline.      Mexico's peso was flat, and was set to clock weekly gains of around 1.2%. A 0.7% drop in Chile's peso led losses in the region on Friday, followed by the Colombian currency's 0.6% dip.     Stocks in the region were mixed. Brazil shares rose 0.3% to hit fresh highs. Airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes  topped the Bovespa index after reporting a 6.5% rise in demand for flights in June.      Mexican shares dipped 0.1%, in line with U.S. stocks that declined after the jobs data.      In Argentina, both stocks and the currency climbed. According to a preliminary draft of the government's upcoming budget proposal, inflation should end 2019 under 40.3% while the economy shrinks 0.8%.

The U.S. dollar        gained against a basket of currencies after an unexpectedly strong U.S. payrolls report that caused investors to rethink how dovish a turn the Federal Reserve may take.

USLNS5IEF6Q,"U.S. job growth surges, July rate cut expectations intact",2019-07-05 00:00:00," By Lucia Mutikani   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth rebounded strongly in June, with government payrolls surging, but persistent moderate wage gains and mounting evidence the economy was losing momentum could still encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this month.   The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday suggested May's sharp slowdown in hiring was probably a fluke. Lack of concrete progress in resolving an acrimonious trade war between the United States and China, however, means the bar could be very high for the Fed not to lower borrowing costs at its July 30-31 policy meeting.    But the strong pace of job gains reduced the chances of a half percentage point rate cut at the end of the month. The U.S. central bank in June signaled it could ease monetary policy as early as this month citing low inflation and growing risks to the economy from an escalation in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.    ""We think the Fed is still on track for a 25 basis points cut given trade uncertainty and the steady downtrend in business sentiment,"" said Andrew Schneider, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas Securities in New York. ""An insurance cut by definition means getting ahead of a downturn, and waiting for employment to roll likely means being too late to deliver one.""    Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 jobs last month as government employment rose by the most in 10 months, and construction and manufacturing hiring regained speed. The economy created only 72,000 jobs in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 160,000 in June.   Job growth averaged 172,000 per month in the first half.  Hiring has cooled from an average of 223,000 jobs per month in 2018, in part as the economy runs out of workers. The pace, however, remains well above the roughly 100,000 needed to keep up with growth in the working age population.   The economy, which has expanded a record 10 years, has shifted into lower gear as the stimulus from last year's massive tax cuts and increased government spending fizzles.    The trade tensions are also dimming the economy's outlook by undercutting business confidence and leading to a downturn in equipment spending and manufacturing.

Trump on Friday said the robust employment gains indicated the United States continued to do ""really, really well"" and ""would be like a rocket ship,"" if the Fed lowered rates.   U.S. House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, welcomed the rebound in job growth, but said ""hard-working Americans are still struggling under the Trump administration's disastrous special interest agenda.""   The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.3% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter.   Average hourly earnings rose six cents or 0.2% in June after gaining 0.3% in May. That kept the annual increase in wages at 3.1% in June for a second straight month.

The surge in hiring was driven by local governments.   But leisure and hospitality sector payrolls increased by a moderate 8,000 in June after rising 18,000 in the prior month.  Professional and business services employment gained 51,000 jobs. There were increases in healthcare and transportation and warehousing employment.   The average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours in June for a third straight month.     ",Boeing Company:-1
USL2N2460MD,TREASURIES-Yields climb on robust U.S. jobs report,2019-07-06 00:00:00,"     * U.S. economy creates 224,000 jobs in June     * Traders price out 1/2-point cut at July Fed meeting     * Markets factor in 25 basis-point cut this month      * U.S. 10-year yields hit 1-week high, 2-year at 2-week peak   (Adds comment; updates prices)     By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss     NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board on Friday, after data showed the world's largest economy created far more jobs than expected in June, suggesting that the Federal Reserve will not aggressively cut interest rates later this month.     Analysts said the strong jobs report should not stop the Fed from reducing interest rates at its July policy meeting, but it did take a 50-basis-point cut off the table.     U.S. benchmark 10-year yields rose to a more than one-week high, while 2-year yields climbed to a two-week peak after the jobs report.     U.S. 10-year yields posted their largest daily rise since early January, while yields on the 2-year had their highest daily gain in more than four years. For 30-year yields, Friday's rise was the largest since early October 2018.     Data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 jobs last month as government employment rose by the most in 10 months. The economy created only 72,000 jobs in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 160,000 in June.     But wage gain growth slowed in June, rising just 0.2%, after gaining 0.3% in May.     ""The short end has abruptly abandoned any thought of a 50-basis-point rate cut this month and now greatly discounts anything other than an insurance cut of 25 basis points for the entire second half of the year,"" said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.     In afternoon trading, 10-year note yields rose to 2.068% , a one-week peak, from 1.955% late on Wednesday. They were last at 2.044%. Ten-year yields hit 1.939% on Wednesday, which was their lowest level since November 2016.     Yields on the 30-year bonds advanced to 2.546%, from 2.471% on Wednesday. At the short end of the curve, 2-year yields were up at 1.869%, from Wednesday's 1.766%. Earlier in the session, 2-year yields touched two-week highs of 1.888%.     After the data, U.S. rate futures have priced in just a 9.0% chance the U.S. central bank will lower interest rates by half a percentage point this month, down from 29% on Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.     Next week's spotlight will be on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who will deliver his semi-annual monetary report before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.      NatWest Markets, in a research note said, investors will be looking out for the Fed's reaction to the U.S.-China trade truce and the June employment numbers to gauge the possibility and  magnitude of an interest rate cut at the Fed's July meeting.

USL2N246011,"Foreign bond buyers lift Mexico peso despite trade threats, downgrades",2019-07-06 00:00:00," By Abraham Gonzalez   MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's peso, which swung wildly in early June after a Fitch downgrade and brief U.S. threat to impose tariffs, has steadied as the country's high interest rates attracted foreign buyers of bonds using borrowed money, analysts and economists said.   Under the ""carry trade"" strategy, investors borrow money in the currency of a country with low interest rates, such as the United States and some European countries, to buy bonds of a high-yield country like Mexico.   Mexico's Central Bank has kept its benchmark interest rate steady at 8.25% since hiking it in December to the highest level among all emerging countries except Turkey and Argentina.     The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate is 2.25%-2.50%.   ""To the extent that the spread of rates was increasing, the carry trade began to become more important,"" said Gabriela Siller, an economist at Mexican bank Banco Base.   Since December 2015 the spread has doubled as the central bank raised rates to contain inflationary pressures, and foreign holdings of Mexican debt have grown by 87.2 billion pesos  ($4.58 billion).   Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador regularly boasts of a strong economy, citing the peso  MXN=  as proof, despite a first-quarter contraction and signs of faltering investor confidence.   U.S. President Donald Trump vowed on May 30 to impose a tariff on all Mexican imports to stem a surge of illegal immigrants across the southern border, but suspended the threat after a bilateral deal was reached.        Fitch Ratings Inc downgraded Mexico's sovereign debt on June 5, citing trade tensions and risks from heavily indebted oil company Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], or Pemex, while Moody's lowered its outlook to negative.      Graphic: Mexican peso, click  tmsnrt.rs/2FRxIDt       The peso has strengthened 3.1% this year, to 19.0244 to the dollar on Friday, after slumping in the final 2018 quarter on Lopez Obrador's decision to cancel a partly built $13 billion airport for Mexico City.   ""It's not more optimism; it's the high yield that has attracted more capital and has sustained the exchange rate,"" said Siller.   Some analysts predict that as long as the U.S.-Mexico spread remains high, the carry trade will sustain the peso.   Joel Martinez, an economist at brokerage firm SIF ICAP, said Mexico is attractive also to investors in countries with low current account deficits and reasonable debt-to-GDP ratios.   Dollar inflows to Mexico from U.S. trade have also supported the exchange rate, with a growing surplus, he added.   Mexico logged a trade surplus of $101.7 million between January and May this year in seasonally adjusted terms, according to official data, compared with a deficit of $4.30 billion in the same period 2018.   ""The balance of payments is healthy,"" said Martinez.

Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose back above 2.0% after hitting their lowest since November 2016 on Wednesday.

Traders lowered their expectations of a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed at its policy meeting on July 30-31, although hopes remained high that the central bank would start easing monetary policy.

The jobs report also pointed to persistent moderate wage gains and mounting evidence that the economy was losing momentum, which could still encourage the Fed to cut rates this month.   The Fed said in its semi-annual report to Congress that the job market had ""continued to strengthen"" so far this year, and described recent weak inflation as ""transitory"".   Shares of banks, which have been under pressure from falling benchmark debt yields in recent weeks, rose 0.8% and helped drive a 0.4% gain in the financial sector, which was the only major S&P sector in the positive territory.   The defensive sectors - real estate, utilities and consumer staples - fell between 0.6% and 0.8% as a rise in U.S. Treasury yields made the dividend-paying companies less appealing.   However, Friday's losses were not severe enough to erode this week's solid gains that took Wall Street's main indexes to record closing highs on hopes of major central banks embracing looser monetary policy and a temporary truce in U.S-China trade dispute.   At 12:46 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 52.15 points, or 0.19%, at 26,913.85, the S&P 500 was down 10.49 points, or 0.35%, at 2,985.33 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 31.04 points, or 0.38%, at 8,139.19.

USL4N2461G6,UK competition regulator puts brake on Amazon's Deliveroo deal,2019-07-05 00:00:00," By Kate Holton and James Davey   (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator has stepped in to pause Amazon's ( AMZN.O ) deal with online food delivery group Deliveroo while it considers launching a full investigation.   Amazon led a $575 million fundraising in Deliveroo in May, making what the two parties called ""a minority investment"" and going up against Uber Eats ( UBER.N ) in the global race to dominate the market for takeaway meal deliveries.   On Friday Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it served an initial enforcement order (IEO) on the two companies on June 24, signaling possible concerns about the transaction.   The regulator, which referred to Amazon's investment as ""a minority shareholding"" said it had reasonable grounds for suspecting that Amazon and Deliveroo ""have ceased to be distinct"" or were putting in place or considering arrangements which would result in them ""ceasing to be distinct"".   The order requires Amazon and Deliveroo to operate independently for now, meaning they cannot press ahead with the tie-up. It gives the regulator time to decide if it will launch a formal ""Phase 1"" competition probe.   The Deliveroo investment is Amazon's latest attempt to enter the takeaway delivery market, worth around $100 billion globally, after it shut down its own service, Amazon Restaurants, first in the UK and then last month in the United States.    Deliveroo said it and Amazon had been working closely with regulators to obtain their approval. The two companies will argue that the investment will help Deliveroo grow its coverage, increase competition and boost the restaurant sector.   ""We believe this minority investment will enable Deliveroo to expand its services, benefiting consumers through increased choice and creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service,"" Amazon said in a statement.   Deliveroo noted that it was competing with a number of major companies in the sector and that the investment would help to create jobs and restaurants to expand.      RESTRICTIONS    IEOs do not prevent parties from continuing to talk to each other, but typically do prevent the transfer of key staff or the transfer of commercially sensitive information.   If the CMA were to undertake an investigation and find competition concerns then the companies could offer undertakings to try to address those concerns. That process could be compromised if the companies had already merged financially.   Neither Deliveroo or Amazon have disclosed a figure for Amazon's funding contribution.   Deliveroo competes in Britain with Just Eat ( JE.L ) and with Uber Eats which is also present in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. It also competes in Europe with Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero.     Headquartered in London, Deliveroo uses 60,000 riders dressed in black and teal jackets to deliver meals from more than 80,000 restaurants and takeaway outlets in 14 countries including France, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuwait.   Since former lawmaker Andrew Tyrie became chairman of the CMA a year a go, it has increasingly bared its teeth. In April it blocked supermarket group Sainsbury's ( SBRY.L ) 7.3 billion pound ($9.2 billion) takeover of rival Asda.    In April the regulator proposed some of the biggest reforms to auditing globally since the aftermath of the Enron scandal, while earlier this month it launched an investigation into the power wielded by Facebook ( FB.O ) and Google ( GOOGL.O ) in digital advertising markets.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index  finished down 0.7% on broad-based losses, capping the week's gains at 1.4%. The index retreated from more than 12-months highs hit a day earlier, fueled by hopes of easier monetary policy from major central banks.   The strong rebound in U.S. job growth in June tempered expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates by 50 basis points this month, which sent the dollar higher and U.S. stocks lower.    However, bets of a 25 basis point cut were still in play as data showed wage gains in the U.S. were tepid.   ""These (jobs growth) are good numbers, but a rate cut in July is still all but inevitable,"" said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.   Hopes of accommodative monetary policy by major central banks and a U.S.-China trade truce were drivers of a fourth week of gains for the European stocks benchmark.   With talks between Washington and Beijing set to resume next week, Citi economist Catherine Mann warned that the truce had not removed the uncertainty that is still weighing on the global growth outlook.   Swedish industrial technology group Hexagon ( HEXAb.ST ) is among those suffering. It announced 700 job cuts and warned of a drop in quarterly organic sales.      One trader said the ""fairly big cut for a one-month downturn"" had sent shockwaves through local firms and any with exposure to China.   Hexagon shares tumbled 11% to the bottom of the STOXX 600 for their worst day in almost nine years.

At 11:01 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 186.45 points, or 0.69%, at 26,779.55, the S&P 500 was down 23.66 points, or 0.79%, at 2,972.16 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 66.81 points, or 0.82%, at 8,103.42.   Trading volumes are likely to be thin at the end of a holiday-shortened week as markets were shut on Thursday for Independence Day holiday.   The Philadelphia chip index fell 1.3% after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd forecast a steep plunge in its second-quarter operating profit, as a supply glut and rising tariffs hit global demand for electronics.   Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.01-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.64-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.   The S&P index recorded 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 25 new lows.

USL2N2421K4,Buoyant U.S. stocks at odds with downbeat market signals,2019-07-05 00:00:00," By April Joyner   NEW YORK (Reuters) - Even as record highs this week in the major U.S. stock indexes telegraph confidence on Wall Street, caution abounds in other U.S. markets, where falling bond yields and flailing small-cap stocks indicate investors are torn about where to place bets.   Hints from Federal Reserve policymakers that the central bank will cut interest rates have buoyed both U.S. stocks and Treasuries. The S&P 500  .SPX , the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  and Nasdaq  .IXIC  have all notched new highs this week, while yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped below 2% to their lowest since late 2016.   Rate cuts often occur in response to signs of emerging economic weakness, which is ultimately negative for equities. Yet lower interest rates are considered supportive of stock valuations by stimulating corporate earnings and capital spending as borrowing costs for companies fall. Such a conundrum was evident on Friday as stocks fell in response to stronger-than-expected U.S. payrolls data, which dampened expectations of a Fed rate cut.   The conflicting signals have given a bid to stocks in defensive sectors such as real estate and consumer staples, yet investors say they are hesitant to abandon cyclical plays, in the event of Fed rate cuts and a trade truce between the United States and China.   ""Investors have got to be nuanced,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh, Scotland. ""I wouldn't disagree with being pro-cyclical or pro-yield.""   It will likely take several months of economic data - along with results from the corporate earnings season later this month - to clarify the picture, investors say. In contrast to Friday's upbeat employment report, data earlier this week showed U.S. manufacturing and service activity in June declined to multi-year lows.    Some are leaning toward an upbeat outlook. The late 2018 swoon in U.S. stocks was an early harbinger of recent softness in economic data, so equity prices have already taken it into account, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. In his view, the S&P's new highs reflect investors' anticipation that the data will turn around with the support of easing monetary policy at the world's major central banks and U.S. fiscal stimulus.   ""There's not as much downside as people portray,"" Paulsen said. ""Every policy official in the world is trying to push up the markets and the economy, everywhere you look.""   Yet the performance in shares of small-cap companies, which tend to be more domestically focused than their large-cap counterparts, belies such optimism. Though it has gained 16.6% for the year, the small-cap Russell 2000 index  has underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index  .SPX , which has risen 19.5%. Whereas other indexes have marked new records, it remains 9.7% below its August 2018 high.   ""Investors are becoming more and more fearful that the economy is in the late cycle, and small caps, rightly or wrongly, are viewed as a play on the U.S. economy,"" said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.    Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York currently forecasts a 29.6% chance of a U.S. recession in the next twelve months. The bank's model, based upon the spread between 10-year and three-month Treasury yields, has reliably predicted recessions once it has hit the 30% threshold, said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a recent note advising a cautious approach toward U.S. equities.   With the muddled market outlook, several market strategists suggest splitting the difference: adding to positions in defensive sectors while looking for opportunities within beaten-up areas of the market, such as small caps.   Such an approach may be especially prudent given the conundrum regarding the U.S. economic outlook, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. Future data, she said, may end up either confirming recession fears or altogether dashing the hopes for interest-rate cuts that have buoyed stocks.   ""The market has got into its head the 'weaker is better' mentality,"" she said. ""Will it be able to substitute stronger economic data for a rate cut?

Analysts said the strong jobs report should not stop the Fed from reducing interest rates in July. What it did though was take the 50 basis-point cut off the table.     U.S. benchmark 10-year yields rose to a more than one-week high, while 2-year yields climbed to a two-week peak after the jobs report.     Data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 jobs last month as government employment rose by the most in 10 months. The economy created only 72,000 jobs in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 160,000 in June.     But wage gain growth slowed in June, rising just 0.2%, after gaining 0.3% in May.     ""Ultimately, should the Fed deliver in July, it will be postured as an 'insurance' cut, coupled with an emphasis on risk to sustained lower inflation expectation,"" said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.     ""The notion of a 50 basis-point cut should be pared back, perhaps not entirely. We expect the market to remain largely priced for a 25 basis-point cut in July.""     In morning trading, U.S. 10-year note yields rose to 2.06%, a one-week peak, from 1.955% late on Wednesday. They were last at 2.054%. Ten-year yields hit 1.939% on Wednesday, which was their lowest level since November 2016.     Yields on U.S. 30-year bonds advanced to 2.557%, from 2.471% on Wednesday.     At the short end of the curve, U.S. 2-year yields were up at 1.873%, from Wednesday's 1.766%. Earlier in the session, two-year yields touched two-week highs.     After the data, U.S. rate futures have priced in just a 9.0% chance the U.S. central bank will lower interest rate by half a percentage point, down from 29% on Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.

USL2N2460G5,Money Markets: Traders bail on bets on deep U.S. rate-cut in July,2019-07-05 00:00:00," NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. interest rates futures tumbled on Friday as traders slashed their bets the Federal Reserve would lower key lending rates by an aggressive 50 basis points in the wake of a surprisingly strong bounce in job growth in June.    Futures prices indicated conviction among traders remain high that U.S. central bank would begin lower borrowing costs at its upcoming policy meeting on July 30-31 amid concerns about softening global growth and sluggish domestic inflation.   On the other hand, some economists said the upbeat payrolls reading gives Fed policymakers time to wait until September to decide on a rate cut.

The U.S. Labor Department said earlier on Friday that domestic employers added 224,000 workers in June, more than the 160,000 increase forecast among economists polled by Reuters.   The May figure was revised to 72,000 from the originally reported 75,000.   Meanwhile, the jobless rate ticked up to 3.7% from a near five-decade low of 3.6%.   Wage growth was modest, rising 0.2% last month, which was slightly less than the 0.3% increase projected among analysts said.

Non-farm payrolls increased by 224,000 jobs last month, the most in five months, and more than the 160,000 jobs forecast by economists.     It came after job growth slowed sharply in May. The economy created 11,000 fewer jobs in April and May than previously reported, the government said on Friday.     ""You look at the U.S. number for today and there’s quite a bit of sticker shock with that,"" said Bipan Rai, North American head of fx strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto. “We think the sticker shock and thin liquidity is enough to drive the dollar a little bit firmer for today.”     The data came as many traders and investors were away, a day after the July 4 holiday and before the weekend.     The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was last at 97.261, the highest since June 19 and up 0.51% on the day.     Moderate wage gains, however, added to evidence that the economy is slowing while the increase in jobs was also not enough to offset weakness in May.     ”You did get a massive upside surprise but again that’s coming after a month in which you had a massive downside miss,"" Rai said. ""If you take the two numbers together you are still averaging at a clip that’s slower than prior years’ growth.""     Average hourly earnings rose six cents or 0.2% after gaining 0.3% in May. That kept the annual increase in wages at 3.1% for a second straight month.     The dollar has weakened from a two-year high reached in May on growing expectations that the Federal Reserve is closer to cutting interest rates.     A relentless slide in European government bond yields, however, has at the same time forced investors to look for higher yielding assets elsewhere, which is holding back a sustained euro rally against the greenback.     The euro also came under pressure on Friday after data showed that German industrial orders fell far more than expected in May and the Economy Ministry warned on Friday that this sector of Europe's largest economy was likely to remain weak in the coming months.       ========================================================     Currency bid prices at 9:19AM (1319 GMT)  Description                         RIC         Last           U.S. Close  Pct Change     YTD Pct     High Bid    Low Bid                                                                  Previous                   Change                                                                                   Session                                             Euro/Dollar                         EUR=        $1.1230        $1.1284     -0.48%         -2.08%      +1.1287     +1.1230  Dollar/Yen                          JPY=        108.4300       107.7900    +0.59%         -1.66%      +108.5000   +107.7900  Euro/Yen                            EURJPY=     121.76         121.67      +0.07%         -3.53%      +121.9200   +121.6100  Dollar/Swiss                        CHF=        0.9915         0.9850      +0.66%         +1.03%      +0.9924     +0.9846  Sterling/Dollar                     GBP=        1.2510         1.2576      -0.52%         -1.94%      +1.2587     +1.2511  Dollar/Canadian                     CAD=        1.3102         1.3050      +0.40%         -3.92%      +1.3127     +1.3045  Australian/Dollar                   AUD=        0.6987         0.7019      -0.46%         -0.88%      +0.7029     +0.6989  Euro/Swiss                          EURCHF=     1.1134         1.1114      +0.18%         -1.07%      +1.1147     +1.1110  Euro/Sterling                       EURGBP=     0.8973         0.8969      +0.04%         -0.12%      +0.8982     +0.8959  NZ Dollar/Dollar                    NZD=        0.6629         0.6686      -0.85%         -1.31%      +0.6694     +0.6629  Dollar/Norway                       NOK=        8.5872         8.5308      +0.66%         -0.60%      +8.5889     +8.5277  Euro/Norway                         EURNOK=     9.6422         9.6278      +0.15%         -2.66%      +9.6499     +9.6237  Dollar/Sweden                       SEK=        9.4084         9.3206      +0.40%         +4.96%      +9.4109     +9.3198  Euro/Sweden                         EURSEK=     10.5650        10.5230     +0.40%         +2.93%      +10.5710    +10.5177    (Editing by Bill Trott)    ",http://www.reuters.com/article/json/data-idUSL2N2460EP,"FOREX-Strong jobs gains send dollar to more than two week highs      * U.S. jobs gains in June beat economists' expectations     * Wage growth remained tepid in the month     * Euro hurt by weak German industrial orders    (New throughout, updates trading and comments to U.S. market open, new byline, changes dateline, previous LONDON)     By Karen Brettell     NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained against a basket of currencies to its highest levels in 2-1/2 weeks on Friday after data showed that U.S. job growth rebounded strongly in June.     Non-farm payrolls increased by 224,000 jobs last month, the most in five months, and more than the 160,000 jobs forecast by economists.     It came after job growth slowed sharply in May. The economy created 11,000 fewer jobs in April and May than previously reported, the government said on Friday.     ""You look at the U.S. number for today and there’s quite a bit of sticker shock with that,"" said Bipan Rai, North American head of fx strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto. “We think the sticker shock and thin liquidity is enough to drive the dollar a little bit firmer for today.”     The data came as many traders and investors were away, a day after the July 4 holiday and before the weekend.     The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was last at 97.261, the highest since June 19 and up 0.51% on the day.     Moderate wage gains, however, added to evidence that the economy is slowing while the increase in jobs was also not enough to offset weakness in May.     ”You did get a massive upside surprise but again that’s coming after a month in which you had a massive downside miss,"" Rai said. ""If you take the two numbers together you are still averaging at a clip that’s slower than prior years’ growth.""     Average hourly earnings rose six cents or 0.2% after gaining 0.3% in May. That kept the annual increase in wages at 3.1% for a second straight month.     The dollar has weakened from a two-year high reached in May on growing expectations that the Federal Reserve is closer to cutting interest rates.     A relentless slide in European government bond yields, however, has at the same time forced investors to look for higher yielding assets elsewhere, which is holding back a sustained euro rally against the greenback.

The likely rebound in U.S. job growth and expectations of a pick up in wage gains would probably not be enough to discourage the Fed from cutting interest rates this month amid growing evidence the economy is slowing.   A spate of weak economic data on Wednesday raised hopes of an interest rate cut and helped the Wall Street's main indexes clinch record closing highs.

USL8N2461FN,Aquis buys London-based NEX in pursuit of European exchange ambition,2019-07-05 00:00:00," By Huw Jones   LONDON (Reuters) - Aquis Exchange ( AQX.L ) moved to create a pan-European listings venue by buying British growth stocks platform NEX Exchange from CME Group ( CME.O ) for a nominal one pound on Friday.   London-based NEX is a minnow in stock market terms but will give Aquis, which can only trade shares listed on other bourses, an off-the-shelf license for a primary or listings exchange.   It has long been regarded as the ""baby brother"" of AIM, the bigger growth market run by the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ).   Aquis Chief Executive Alasdair Haynes said the intention was not to compete harder with AIM - where Aquis is itself listed - but to become a ""disruptor"" by developing a pan-European listings market using Aquis' new European Union base in Paris.   NEX has 89 listings including Arbuthnot bank, Newbury Racecourse, brewer Adnams and English sparkling wine producer Chapel Down, with a combined market capitalization of 1.9 billion pounds ($2.38 billion).   ""The immediate reaction that people have is that they look at NEX as the baby brother of AIM and that its big selling point is that it's cheaper,"" Haynes told Reuters.   ""Cheaper is not the answer to all this. This is about process change that makes the market more efficient.""   The deal is due to be closed in the autumn, pending regulatory approval, and includes Aquis paying 2.7 million pounds ($3.4 million) to cover NEX's working capital.   Independent financial research company Liberum said management expectations that Aquis itself will become profitable in 2020 were not changed by buying NEX, although NEX is forecast to lose a million pounds over the next two years.   ""Aquis' intention is to use its technology to enhance liquidity and so create a more competitive and attractive listing venue,"" Liberum said in a note to clients.   A veteran of the exchanges world, Haynes helped to build the then Chi-x platform into Europe's biggest pan-European stock trading platform and now known as Cboe Europe.   The EU is keen to create a capital markets union where small companies issue shares and bonds to raise funds rather than relying on bank loans, but progress has been slow at a time when many listed companies are going private.   One way of attracting more listings and liquidity onto NEX would be to allow companies to say that holders of shares are not allowed to lend them to hedge funds and others who short or take bets on a stock falling, Haynes said.

USL4N2461FF,"GM, Ford quarterly China sales slide again amid economy woes",2019-07-05 00:00:00," By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu   BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) announced their quarterly sales in China fell, albeit at a slower pace sequentially, as the U.S. automakers were hit by a slowing economy amid the Sino-U.S. trade war.   GM's vehicle sales in China for the quarter ended June 30 dropped 12.2%, while Ford's sales slumped by 21.7%. While GM also suffered from heightened competition in its key mid-priced SUV segment, Ford was hurt by the limited new models for customers to choose from.   For the first quarter of this year, Ford's sales in China tumbled 35.8 percent while GM's skid 17.5 percent.   Still, the numbers from GM, the second biggest international automaker in China by sales, and Ford portend more uncertainty for the industry which is trying to rebound from a downward spiral that led to its first annual sales decline last year in more than two decades.   GM delivered 1.57 million vehicles in China in the January-June period this year, while Ford delivered 290,321 vehicles.   China's factory activity shrank more than expected in June, highlighting the need for more economic stimulus amid higher U.S. tariffs and weaker domestic demand.   Annual car sales in China fell last year for the first time since the 1990s, and they are expected to fall this year too. Sales tumbled 16.4% in May from the same month a year prior, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said. That marked the 11th consecutive month of decline and followed falls of 14.6% in April and 5.2% in March.   U.S. car companies' share of total China passenger vehicles sales fell to 9.6% in the first five months of this year from 10.9% in the year-ago period, according to CAAM. Over the same period, German car makers' share has risen to 23.3% from 20.9% and Japanese auto makers' to 21.3% from 17.3%.   CAAM is set to announce June sales next week, which industry analysts forecast will be negative.      NEW MODELS   In China, GM has a joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp ( 600104.SS ), in which the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac are made. It also has another venture, with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group, in which they make no-frills minivans and have started to make higher-end cars.   Sales of GM's affordable brand Baojun dropped 31.8% for the latest quarter. But luxury brand Cadillac's sales jumped 36.6%.   GM sold 3.64 million units in China last year, down from 4.04 units in 2017.   Ford makes cars in China through its joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd ( 000625.SZ ) and Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) ( 000550.SZ ). It has said it would partner with Zotye Automobile Co Ltd ( 000980.SZ ) to sell lower priced cars.   The Dearborn, Michigan automaker has been struggling to revive sales in China, its second biggest market globally, after its business began slumping in late 2017. Sales sank 37 percent in 2018, after a 6 percent decline in 2017.   GM, Ford and rivals are launching new models or sprucing up older ones to attract customers. GM has laid out plans to introduce around 20 new models or variants of older ones this year.   ""Around two-thirds of the about 20 new and refreshed models will arrive in the second half with a sharpened focus on luxury vehicles and mid-size to large SUVs,"" a GM spokeswoman told Reuters, adding that more than half of the new launches will be new models.   Ford has said it plans to localize its luxury brand Lincoln in China and would launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years of which over a third will be electric vehicles.   It has launched new models such as Focus and Territory to boost volumes in China.

USL8N2461P9,Wells Fargo fined in Ireland over reporting breaches,2019-07-05 00:00:00," DUBLIN (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's ( WFC.N ) Irish subsidiary was fined 5.9 million euros on Friday for a prolonged series of regulatory reporting breaches, the second largest fine ever handed down by Ireland's Central Bank.   The Central Bank said Wells Fargo Bank International Unlimited Company admitted to five breaches from 2014 to 2019, including a failure to accurately report its capital position that revealed ""serious and systemic weaknesses"" in its reporting capability.   A spokesperson for Wells Fargo said the bank took its regulatory obligations seriously and had made significant improvements to its systems and processes since the breaches occurred.   Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, has been beset by a string of mis-selling scandals in its home market, prompting billions of dollars in fines and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve.   Its Irish incorporated business has branches in London and Frankfurt, offering corporate lending across Europe, according to the bank's website. It had a turnover of $586 million in 2018, the central bank said.   ""It is a minimum requirement of being regulated by the Central Bank that firms submit accurate and timely regulatory returns,"" Director of Enforcement Seana Cunningham said in a statement.    ""This enforcement action refers to failings in relation to both capital reporting and liquidity testing. For that reason it is considered to be particularly serious.""   The other breaches included a failure to properly document processes and procedures, the lack of robust board and senior management oversight and a failure to comply with regulatory requirements in relation to liquidity testing.   Weak IT systems also necessitated an excessively high level of manual adjustments in the preparation of regulatory returns, which the central bank said contributed to incorrect calculations.   Wells Fargo initially did not complete required remedial action in 2017 but has since taken the necessary steps to rectify the failings, the regulator said.   That reduced the fine from the ""appropriate level"" of 8.4 million euros ($9.46 million), in line with central bank settlement procedures. The 5.9 million euro fine is the second largest after a 21 million euro fine imposed on Irish lender Permanent TSP ( IL0A.I ) for overcharging mortgage customers, a central bank spokesman said.   It was also the second reprimand for an Irish subsidiary of a major U.S. bank in the space of 10 days after JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) was fined 1.6 million euros ($1.8 million) for regulatory breaches in outsourcing.

The index had closed at a more than 12-months high a day before, helped by a rally fuelled by hopes of an easing economic policy from major central banks and by news that the United States and China were going to restart their trade talks.   Citi economist Catherine Mann said the temporary trade truce is vulnerable to further escalation should the negotiations fall apart.   ""The U.S.-China handshake has not removed trade policy uncertainty, which is still weighing on the global growth outlook,"" Mann said.   Meanwhile, the long-drawn trade spat showed its impact on Swedish industrial technology group Hexagon, which announced 700 job cuts and warned of a drop in quarterly organic sales.   Its shares tumbled 13.6% to the bottom of STOXX 600. The results weighed on the shares of Schneider Electric, Siemens and Sandvik and pulled the industrial index down 1.5%.   ""Industrials are in focus this morning and attracting the most action following the surprise warning from Hexagon,"" a trader said. ""A fairly big cut for a 1-month downturn, citing China, sending shockwaves into the local companies and Chinese tech exposures.""   The pain from the tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariff war on the semicondutor industry once again came to the fore after Samsung Electronics forecast a plunge in its second-quarter operating profit.   The news dragged technology shares 0.8% lower, with AMS, STMicroelectronics and Siltronic slipping between more than 1%.   In U.S. financial markets, investors will return from Independence Day holiday to focus on the non-farm payrolls, which is due at 12:30 GMT.   U.S. job growth was likely to rebound in June, but that would probably not be enough to discourage the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates this month amid growing evidence the economy is slowing.   Dampening the sentiment further was data which showed German industrial orders fell far more than expected in May.   Defensive sectors such as real estate, utilities and telecom, which are popular in times of economic strife, eked out gains, while mining stocks, down 1.7%, were among the biggest drags on the markets.   Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.25%, more than its peers, pressured by declines in mining majors Rio Tinto plc and BHP Group.
